Here's a breakdown of the code :

---

### 1. Setting up Variables
```AMPscript
%%[
SET @HolidayQuizTitle1 = AttributeValue("HolidayQuizTitle1")
...
SET @HolidayQuizTitle4 = AttributeValue("HolidayQuizTitle4")
]%%
```
- This section sets up four variables (`@HolidayQuizTitle1` to `@HolidayQuizTitle4`). Each one is pulling a value from the subscriber data using `AttributeValue()`.

---

### 2. Constructing the Array
```AMPscript
SET @HolidayQuizTitles = BuildRowsetFromString(CONCAT(@HolidayQuizTitle1, ",", @HolidayQuizTitle2, ...), ",")
]%%
```
- Here, it's combining the four title variables into a comma-separated string.
- Then, it turns this string into a rowset (similar to an array) using `BuildRowsetFromString()`.

---

### 3. Looping through Quiz Titles
```AMPscript
FOR @i = 1 TO RowCount(@HolidayQuizTitles) DO
...
NEXT @i
]%%
```
- A loop that goes through each of the quiz titles in `@HolidayQuizTitles`.

---

### 4. Product Lookup
```AMPscript
SET @currentQuizTitle = Field(@currentQuizTitleRow, 1)
SET @ProductLookup = LookupRows("Jebbit_ProductFeed", "Title", @currentQuizTitle)
]%%
```
- For the current quiz title, it looks up related products in the `Jebbit_ProductFeed` data extension using `LookupRows()`.

---

### 5. Looping through Products
```AMPscript
IF RowCount(@ProductLookup) > 0 THEN
    FOR @j = 1 TO RowCount(@ProductLookup) DO
    ...
    NEXT @j
ENDIF
]%%
```
- If there are any products that match the current quiz title, loop through each product.

---

### 6. Fetching Product Details
```AMPscript
SET @ProductRow = Row(@ProductLookup, @j)
...
SET @product_image = Field(@ProductRow, "Image_URL")
]%%
```
- This section extracts product details from the `Jebbit_ProductFeed` data extension. This includes product ID, name, redirect URL, and image URL.

---

### 7. Constructing the HTML Table for Product
```HTML
<table ...>
...
</table>
```
- A table is built for each product. 
- It contains:
  - Product image with a link to the product's URL.
  - Product name.
  - Product ID.
- Uses `%%=RedirectTo(@product_url)=%%` and `%%=v(@product_name)=%%` to embed the AMPscript variables into the HTML.

### Guidelines for Future Modifications:

1. **Add More Quiz Titles**: If you need more quiz titles, simply create more variables like `@HolidayQuizTitle5`, `@HolidayQuizTitle6`, etc. and update the `BuildRowsetFromString()` function.

2. **Modify Data Extension Lookup**: If you need to lookup in a different data extension or using a different field, adjust the `LookupRows()` function accordingly.

3. **Change Product Details Displayed**: Adjust the table structure and variables inside the HTML to display different product details or styles.

4. **Other Data Extensions**: If you want to use another data extension, change the name inside the `LookupRows()` function.

5. **Change Display Styles**: Modify the CSS inside the table tags to change the appearance.

---

Remember: Any modification in the logic part (like adding more quiz titles or looking up in a different data extension) requires a corresponding adjustment in the loop and display part of the code.
